# Osama Bin Laden's Death: Effect on US airline stock prices

## Abstract
The 9/11 attacks shocked the world and the stock market negatively. We hypothesize that the announcement of the death of Osama Bin Laden on May 2nd, 2011 would shock the stock markets positively. In order to investigate the effect of the death of Bin Laden on stock prices of US airlines we conduct an event study analysis using the Fama French Three Factor model. We use daily stock price data of nine publicly traded US airlines and find that our hypothesis is confirmed. Further, different airlines are differentially impacted by the shock. We conclude that there is a correlation between market size of an airline and the magnitude of the impact by the shock.
